# headandshoulders
A 2D animation video for kids created in Adobe Animate / Macromedia flash

This is a journal of the making of head and shoulders. It's a frame by frame animation for my YouTube channel, nicoltoons.

ðŸŒ± 2 simple characters : A boy and a girl will illustrate what the song is teaching.

ðŸŒ±A song for this video was generated using A.I.

ðŸŒ± YouTube Video shorts will be and are currently being posted as production continues.
